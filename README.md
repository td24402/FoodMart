In this day and age, companies look towards sales and data in order to make accurate decisions that will serve a purpose for them moving into the future. This is otherwise known as data-driven decision-making. Data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is defined as using facts, metrics, and data to guide strategic business decisions that align with your goals, objectives, and initiatives.
In this project I used the Microsoft Access Database to access many of the stores, to figure out which stores are perferming well and which are not. I looked at the worst performing stores and calculated which stores should discontinue due to revenue vs cost of goods and cost of maintenance. I also looked at the best selling stores and what makes them the best. As a result of my research, I was able to come up with a number of strategies for improving a store's performance, both by copying the best-performing stores' practices and by avoiding the bad ones.
